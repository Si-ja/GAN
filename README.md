# GAN
A simple GAN made with PyTorch

# Current status

Development
It is possible to generate images, as ones present in the generated examples.
For that you need to run the `generate.py` in the main folder. Without the 
describtion what tools are being used for this (i.e. modules) it might be more
difficult, however, if you have PyTorch installed and matplolib, you should be
able to work with the given approach. A more detailed set of instructions is to
come.

# Plans
- [] Give an ability to the user to re-train the network
- [] Add arguments reader, where arguments could be passed so the user could
save or operate with certain parameters as they wish
- [] Give a describtion what environment is required to generate images and operate
with the neural networks
